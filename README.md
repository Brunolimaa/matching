# Device Matching Backend Service

This is a simple backend service built using Java 11, Spring Boot 2, and Aerospike. The service accepts User-Agent strings and matches a device with the same characteristics (OS name, OS version, Browser name, and Browser version).

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

- **Java 11**: The backend is built using Java 11.
- **Spring Boot 2**: The service is built using Spring Boot 2 for ease of development and scalability.
- **Aerospike**: Aerospike is used as the database to store device information.

## Requirements

Before you can run the project, you need to have the following installed:

- **Docker**: Docker is required to run Aerospike using Docker Compose.
- **Docker Compose**: For managing multi-container Docker applications.
- **Java 11**: Make sure Java 11 is installed for building and running the Spring Boot application.
